# JSON Against Humanity

Finally, [Cards Against Humanity](https://cardsagainsthumanity.com/) as plain text and JSON.

## FAQ

### How many cards are there?

There are 31,700 cards available from 205 different packs and boxes.

- That's all 5,702 official cards from 71 different products
- Plus 25,998 even worse cards from fans around the world

### Wha— where the heck did you find all those cards??

The primary source is [this Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ajv9fdKngBJ_dHFvZjBzZDBjTE16T3JwNC0tRlp6Wnc&usp=sharing#gid=55) I found through [Board Game Geek](https://boardgamegeek.com/). Previous sources included [Hangouts Against Humanity](https://github.com/samurailink3/hangouts-against-humanity), [Pretend You're Xyzzy](http://pyx-3.pretendyoure.xyz/zy/viewcards.jsp), and contributions from viewers like you.

### What font is CAH?

Cards Against Humanity® cards are printed in [Helvetica® Neue](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/neue-helvetica/). It's not free. I use [Inter Medium](https://rsms.me/inter/). You're looking at it now.

### I want to give you money.

That's very nice of you but you legally can't. [More on that later](#fine-print). You should instead donate to [local community bail funds](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/bail_funds_george_floyd).

## File formats

### Plaintext

```
White, answer cards.
Putting a new card on each line.
Adding a divider after the white cards.
----------
I love it when my _ are in plaintext.
How are these cards styled?
Are **you** telling **me** that _these cards_ are styled with Markdown and _?
```

### full.json

```json
[
  {
    "name": "The Base Set",
    "description": "Sweet dirty vanilla",
    "official": true,
    "white": [
      {
        "text": "Answer cards in plain text, formatted with **Markdown**",
        "pack": 0
      }
    ],
    "black": [
      {
        "text": "_Prompt_ cards\nwith _ for blanks!",
        "pick": 1,
        "pack": {pack index}
      }
    ]
  },
  { "white": [ { "pack": 1 }, ... ], ... },
  { "white": [ { "pack": 2 }, ... ], ... }
]
```

### compact.json

I wrote a small library to take advantage of this concise format: [CAHDeck.js](https://github.com/crhallberg/json-against-humanity/blob/latest/web/CAHDeck.js).

```json
{
  "white": ["Answer cards in plain text, formatted with **Markdown**"],
  "black": [
    { "text": "_Prompt_ cards\nformatted with _.", "pick": 1 },
    { "text": "I want a _ **and** _ sandwich! No corners!", "pick": 2 }
  ],
  "packs": {
    "abbreviation": {
      "name": "The Base Set",
      "description": "Sweet dirty vanilla",
      "official": true,
      "white": [0, 1, 2, "indexes for every white card in this pack"],
      "black": [0, 1, 2, "indexes for every black card in this pack"]
    }
  }
}
```
